# Product Data Science Interview Prep Guide

Last Update: Aug, 2023

Hello, welcome to my collection of Data Science Interview Prep Materials! This set of notes is aimed to provide summary pointers on important concepts, as well as tips and tricks, to commonly seen questions and patterns during Product Data Science interviews. My goal is to share my knowledge and my preparation, and I hope you can find some of it helpful. 

Note: this set of summaries DOES NOT replace actually reading through textbooks, interview prep books and doing practice SQL problems. Gotta put in the hardwork my friend.
